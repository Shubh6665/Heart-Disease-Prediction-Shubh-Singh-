❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Project 📈
Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction project! 🎉 This comprehensive project utilizes the power of Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive interface for predicting heart disease. Leveraging machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors from the Scikit-learn library, this project achieves impressive accuracies ranging from 67% to 76%. 💻

Required Modules:
• NumPy
• Pandas
• Flask
• Scikit-learn
• Pickle
• Pyttsx3
• Threading

💻 Machine Learning algorithms used:
• Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
• Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
• K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)

Future Scopes:
• Early Detection and Risk Stratification:
  Identifying Early Signs:
    Machine learning could be used to analyze subtle 
    changes in vital signs or routine health data to
    detect early signs of heart disease progression.

• Clinical Decision Support and Intervention:

   Real-Time Risk Assessment:
    Integrating ML models into hospital
    systems could enable real-time risk
    assessment during patient consultations,
    aiding doctors in clinical decision-making.
